# wallaby-wifi-clientor
Changes the KIPR Wallaby robotics platform from being a wifi hotspot into being a wifi client, able to connect to standard wifi networks.

# Caveats and Warnings
This script may break everything you love. We are not liable in that case. This script may be everything you've ever wanted. We're not liable for that either. No liabilities. That's the game.

# Uni-Directional
This script backs up your files so you *could* restore everything in theory. However the script is currently only unidirectional. It will convert your Wallaby from being a wifi hotspot into a wifi client. If you want to revert, it may be easiest to re-image the Wallaby for now.

# Use and Installation Instructions
Download and place the wallaby_update.sh script onto a usb thumbdrive. Plug the thumbdrive into the USB port on the Wallaby and go into the standard Wallaby updates menu. Click to run the script.
